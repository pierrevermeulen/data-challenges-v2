## Reviews Translator üìö

We now have a first understanding of the impact of some variables on customer satisfaction. In particular, the review score seems negatively impacted by the duration of order deliveries.

But quantitative analysis is not our only source of information. We have access to written reviews content!

A good practice when discovering a new dataset is always to pick some observations at random, and read all we have about them.

Let's confront our quantitative findings to a qualitative analysis of reviews from customers.

### Exercise

- Implement a Python script that translates from Portuguese to English a sample of 100 1-star reviews, leveraging the Python library [googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not translate all the 100,000 comments or the whole class might get temporarily banned from most free API translators**
- Are those trends similar to your previous findings?
- What other trends are you uncovering and you would like to explore?

Hints:
- Try to read the doc and make the API works on your own - it's no more than 10 lines of code
- Feel free to create a new notebook, or code directly on your favorite code editor
