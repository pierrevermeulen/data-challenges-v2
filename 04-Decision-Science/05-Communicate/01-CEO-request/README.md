### Finalize your analysis

Continue working on yesterday's `ceo-request.ipynb` notebook as needed to answer the question

> _Should Olist remove underperforming sellers from its marketplace?_

ðŸš€ Feel free to start from the solutions `seller_updated_solution.py` and `product_updated_solution.py` available to download from yesterday's recap challenge.
They contain profits_per_seller and profits_per_products.

### Present your analysis at 5pm!

You have 5 minutes per person (Q&A included) to convince Olist CEO of your recommendations.

- We will create one group of student per Teacher/TAs
- Each one of you will present your analysis in front of your group
- The TA will play the role of the CEO.

ðŸ‘‰ You will have to make a slide-based presentation using Jupyter Noteobook **nbconvert**

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to slides --post serve <your_notebook.ipynb>
```

ðŸ’« Stop analysis by 2pm to have time to polish your presentation and speech

- Should Olist remove the worst performing products / categories from its marketplace entirely?
- Should Olist restricts (seller, customer) pairs between certain states to avoid delays?
- Olist acquire new sellers, with some cost assumptions to be suggested?
- ...
