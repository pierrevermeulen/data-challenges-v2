# ML Workflow overview

Here we will go through a complete ML workflow together.

# Exercice

You need to install 2 packages:
- `s3fs` to fetch the dataset from an AWS S3 bucket
- `folium` to display maps

```bash
pip install -U s3fs folium
```

Open `ML-Workflow.ipynb` notebook and follow steps.

NB: you won't have a lot to implement on this exercice. Simply run the cells and make sure to understand the different steps.
