## Let's create our first API exposing our model

Yesterday, we trained our TaxiFare model in the cloud using the **AI Platform**.

We saved one or more versions of our model in `model.joblib` files.

Let's use our best performing model in order to make predictions.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not forget that we cannot load our model without the code that was used in order to train it! ‚ö†Ô∏è

### First step: let's create an API endpoint and test it

In `api/fast.py`, let's create a root endpoint that will welcome the developers using our API.

In order to do that, we will use **FastAPI**.

The endpoint will simply return the following json content when a developer hits the root of our API : http://localhost:8000/

``` json
{
  "key": "value"
}
```

*Hint*: you may use the `make run_api` **Makefile** directive in order to run the **uvicorn** web server that will serve the API.

Once the server is started, you can play with the API either directly: http://localhost:8000/

... Or through the **Swagger** documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs (click on the endpoint you wish to play with, then hit `Try it out`)

### Receive the parameters for the prediction

We have a basic endpoint for our API, but that is not very useful...

Let's create a `/predict_fare` endpoint that will be used for the predictions.

We want developers to provide the following parameters to the endpoint:
- `pickup_datetime`
- `pickup_longitude`
- `pickup_latitude`
- `dropoff_longitude`
- `dropoff_latitude`
- `passenger_count`

As a response, let's first send back the provided values in order to make sure that everything is connected correctly:

For example, when called with the following parameters: http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict_fare/2013-07-06 17:18:00 UTC/-73.950655/40.783282/-73.984365/40.769802/1

... The API would respond:

``` json
{
  "pickup_datetime": "2013-07-06 17:18:00 UTC",
  "pickup_longitude": "-73.950655",
  "pickup_latitude": "40.783282",
  "dropoff_longitude": "-73.984365",
  "dropoff_latitude": "40.769802",
  "passenger_count": "1"
}
```

### Predicting the fare amount

Now that the piping is done, let's make an actual prediction.

But first, we need to store the API parameters as an observation in an `X_pred` dataframe.

The columns should match the format of the `X_train` having served to train the pipeline of our model. Otherwise the pipeline will output a python error...

*Hint*: the code provided for the TaxiFare model uses an additional **key** column. Its value (for example `key="2013-07-06 17:18:00.000000119"`) will not affect the model, but, if the column is missing, the pipeline will not accept the dataframe as an input...

‚ö†Ô∏è Also, beware to the order of the columns when you create the dataframe! ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pandas** does not care about the order of the columns, but **Numpy** does, and you might end up surprised by the results if you build a dataframe with an incorrect order of columns...

Now that we have created a `X_pred` dataframe, let's make a prediction.

Let's load our model, either from **Google Cloud Storage** or from our local hard drive.

We just need to store the resulting prediction in our **json** response:

``` json
{
  "prediction": 1.234
}
```

*Hint*: in order to play with your API, you may either fill the parameters manually in the URL, or use the notebook provided in `notebooks/API usage.ipynb`.

‚ö†Ô∏è The notebook is built to query an API responding to the following URL... Maybe you will want to adapt the way the notebook works if you choose a different format for your API ‚ö†Ô∏è

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict_fare/?key=2012-10-06 12:10:20.0000001&pickup_datetime=2012-10-06 12:10:20 UTC&pickup_longitude=40.7614327&pickup_latitude=-73.9798156&dropoff_longitude=40.6513111&dropoff_latitude=-73.8803331&passenger_count=2`

Congratulations, you just created your first API! üéâ

Let's see how we can put this API into production so that it gets exposed to the internet üöÄ
