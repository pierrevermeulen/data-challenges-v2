## Create a budget alert

All GCP services are paying, and remember that you entered your credit card in GCP on setup day.

Creating a budget alert will allow you to be notified when your expense thresholds are reached.

It will allow you to fine tune your usage of the Google Cloud Platform.

Open the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)...

Go to Billing / Budgets & alerts
- CREATE BUDGET

or [follow the guide](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets#add-new-budget).
