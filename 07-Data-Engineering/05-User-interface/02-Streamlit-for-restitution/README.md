# Create a streamlit website

We have just plugged an existing front-end to our **API**.

We will now create our own website using **Streamlit**.

Let's install the requirements provided inside `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Let's inspect `app.py` and check what is being done inside...

# Plug your prediction API

Replace the URL to the prediction API with your own and update the code accordingly.

Now let's get crazy with the page content ðŸŽ‰

Maybe add some map ðŸ—º

Once you are satisfied, let's push the code to production! ðŸ”¥

# Deploy

Now that you checked your app works locally, you might want it to run free on a remote server.

## Create folder outside data-challenges

As heroku is based on `git`, we will create a folder outside of the `data-challenges` folder.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/taxifare_streamlit
cp -rf * ~/code/taxifare_streamlit/
cd ~/code/taxifare_streamlit/
```

Version it for future Heroku use:

```bash
cd ~/code/taxifare_streamlit/ && git init
```

## Deploy to heroku

You'll see once again how Heroku is easy to use, here you simply need to:

- Create a `Procfile` with following line inside:

```bash
web: streamlit run app.py
```

```bash
git add . && git commit -am "add streamlit app"
```

- Login to Heroku

```bash
heroku login
```

- Create an app on Heroku
```bash
heroku create YOUR_APP_NAME --region eu
```

- Push it on Heroku and have it built using git

```bash
git push heroku master
```

- Then deploy

```bash
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

Click on the link `https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/` and it should return `OK` ðŸš€
