In this exercise, we will analyze the US Oil & Gas production from June 2008 to June 2018. The dataset is [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/djzurawski/us-oil-and-gas-production-june-2008-to-june-2018), and we already downloaded the CSVs in the exercise folder. They are located under the `data` subfolder, no need for you to download it again.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your browser should _automatically_ open Jupyter. You should see the exercise folder with `data`, `README.md`, etc. Click on the `Exercise.ipynb` link to open the notebook. This is where you will write notes & Python code. When analyzing data, we don't start with sublime text/VS Code and write code, we stay in the notebook. Sublime text/VS Code will come later when we will do some **Data Engineering** and create a script to be run at once.

In the Notebook exercises of today and the following days, you will go back & forth between these instructions and the Notebook where you will write the code. Have fun!

## Start documenting

There should be a default code cell in your notebook, change its type to **Markdown** and copy-paste the following in it:

```markdown
## US Oil and Gas Production

Analysing the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/djzurawski/us-oil-and-gas-production-june-2008-to-june-2018) with information about Oil and Gas production in the US from June 2008 to June 2018.
```

Type `â‡§ + â†©` to save and exit edit mode.

## Loading Modules

In the next code cell, copy paste the following:

```python
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib
```

Type `â‡§ + â†©` to **run** the code. It will be _remembered_ throughout the Jupyter Session (until you kill the `jupyter notebook` command in your terminal with `Ctrl+C`).

## Loading data from a CSV

Change the type of the last cell to Markdown and copy-paste the following in it:

```markdown
---

Let's load the Gas production:
```

Remember, a Jupyter notebook is not just about writing Python code, otherwise we would have stayed in sublime text/VS Code!


Insert a cell below (code, the default) and write the two lines to load the **gas** consumption. Then visualize the `DataFrame` with the `.head()` function. When you are done, type `Ctrl` + `â†©` to run the code.

```python
file = "data/U.S._natural_gas_production.csv"
gas_df = pd.read_csv(file, decimal=",")
gas_df.head(3)
```

Type `â‡§ + â†©` to **run** the code. You should see the [**`head(n)`**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html) of the DataFrame

There are some cells you might _always_ want to add just after having loaded a CSV file into a dataframe to get some insights about the **structure** and **size**:

```python
gas_df.shape
```

```python
gas_df.columns
```

```python
gas_df.dtypes[0:2] # Checking the types of the first two columns.
```

With this last one, we can see that the column `Month` is loaded as an `object` and **not** recognized as a date! We need to help Pandas a bit and do some post-load treatment on it. Let's do that in our next section:

## Converting the `Month` column to `datetime`

Open and read the documentation on [`pd.to_datetime()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html). Insert a new code cell and try to **update** the `Month` column to a proper `datetime`.


<details><summary markdown='span'>ðŸ†˜ Hint</summary>

Check out [`pd.to_datetime()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html)

</details>

Once you've done that, you can treat the values inside the column `Month` as `datetime` object:

```python
gas_df['Month'].dt.year.head()
```

```python
gas_df['Month'].dt.month.tail()
```

## Grouping rows

As we are starting a new block of exploration, insert a **Markdown** cell and append the following code:

```markdown
---

## Yearly Gas production
```

Now that we have prepared the dataframe, we can try to answer a first Business-related question:

> How much gas has been produced yearly globally and in every state of the US?

To answer this question, we need to **aggregate** the rows based on the year of the `Month` column. Go ahead, insert a new code cell and code this aggregation using [`DataFrame.groupby()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) and [`DataFrame.sum()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sum.html).

Once we have this aggregated dataframe, time to **plot** the total production in the `U.S.` thanks to the [`DataFrame.filter()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.filter.html) and the [`DataFrame.plot()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) functions.

## Discarding rows with Boolean Indexing

In the previous section, we've seen that the production data are not complete for the year 2008 and 2018 (we only have half of the year). We'd like to continue working with full years, meaning we need to discard the first and last rows of `yearly_gas_df` based on the year.

We are going to look at the **index** of the DataFrame, and build a boolean condition using [`np.logical_and`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.logical_and.html):

```python
np.logical_and(yearly_gas_df.index >= 2009, yearly_gas_df.index <= 2017)
```

How can you use this [`np.ndarray`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) and [**boolean indexing**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing) to keep only the full years in `yearly_gas_df`? Can you plot it?


## Plotting several columns

Let's now create a new section in our Notebook to analyze the Gas production of different states in the US. First, let's insert a **Markdown** cell:

```markdown
### State production

Let's have a look at the yearly production of some specific states
```

Then let's have a look at the available states, looking at all the columns _except_ the first one:

```python
full_yearly_gas_df.columns[1:].sort_values()
```

:question: Can you insert a new cell and write the code to plot linecharts of the gas production of four states of your choice? You can start from the `full_yearly_gas_df` dataframe.

## Loading a second CSV

The Kaggle dataset we are using does not only have information about the gas production, there is also some about the **crude oil** one. Create a new section in your Notebook with the following Markdown cell:

```markdown
---

## Comparing with Crude Oil Production
```

Create a new dataframe for the oil:

- Load it with the [`pd.read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) function
- Parse the `Month` column into a `datetime` object

Then create two dataframes `yearly_gas` and `yearly_oil` by grouping by year, summing and filtering the **total US** production for both commodities. [Rename the columns](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11346283/renaming-columns-in-pandas) to `Gas` and `Crude oil`.

Now that you have those two dataframes, create one by concatenating both. Store this new dataframe into a `yearly_merged` variable. You should use the [`pd.concat()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html), and don't forget to set the `axis` parameter!

Finally, plot the `yearly_merged` dataframe and try to set the legend to include the units advertised in the original [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/djzurawski/us-oil-and-gas-production-june-2008-to-june-2018).

That's it, congratulations on completing your first Data Analysis through a Jupyter Notebook :clap: :rocket:

## Pushing your code to GitHub

There is no `make` for this challenge, still don't forget to go back to the terminal and `add` / `commit` / `push` your changes!
