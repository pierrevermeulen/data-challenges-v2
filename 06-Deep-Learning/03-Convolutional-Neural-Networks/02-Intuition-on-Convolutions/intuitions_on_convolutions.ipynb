    "**Convolutional Neural Networks** correspond the Neural Networks that are specially designed to work on images. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is made possible thanks to _convolutions_. This specific mathematical operations applies a _kernel_ to an input image and creates an output representation. The name of this output can change depending on the community. Here, let's talk about the output as it corresponds to the output of a layer, as in standard DL neurons. But it can also be \"convoluted representation/feature\", \"convolution\", or also \"activation\" as it corresponds to the activation of a given layer.\n",

    "<img src=\"convolution.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ It is important to get that the same kernel, i.e. the same weights, are applied to different zones of the images. This is very different from standard DL operations where each weight of each neuron is related to only one input coordinate (which in this case would be each pixel). Here, the weight of a kernel is not applied to only one input, i.e. one pixel, but to different pixels, \"step by step\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of each kernel (or each filter in case of color image) as a magnifying glass through which you see the image. Similarly to your eyes which have to do not capture everything at once, but that have to look at different parts before to capture the whole thing you are looking at.\n",
