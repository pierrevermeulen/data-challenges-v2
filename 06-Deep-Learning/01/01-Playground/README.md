# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 1 - Playground

The first exercise is an gentle introduction to Deep Learning. Thanks to the Tensorflow playground, a site that emulates a neural network, you will get a better intuition of the operations that are going on in a neural network. It is also intended to give you a visual representation of neural networks that will ease your comprehension for the rest of the week.
