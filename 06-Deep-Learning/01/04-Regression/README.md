# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 1 - Regression

The final exercise is a regression task which is (after the 2-class and multi-class classification) the last supervised task you will tackle with Neural Networks during the week.
The data corresponds to the Boston Housing dataset that uses features related to the quality of a housing.
