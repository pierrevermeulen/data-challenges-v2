# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 1 - Regression

The last exercise is an open challenge.

You are given real data, for which the goal is to set the neural network that has the best architecture to predict the problem at hand. This means that you should select:
- The architecture of the Neural network (NN) : number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, ...
- The loss of the NN
- The optimizer of the NN

This exercise will get your hands dirty with application without much guidance, as in real-life problems.
