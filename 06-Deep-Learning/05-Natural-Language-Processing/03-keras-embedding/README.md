# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 5 - Keras Embedding


In this challenge, you will use keras Embedding layer to learn the embedding of the word in your train corpus in order to perform some sentiment analysis.

Here, the emphasis is done on the underlying advantages and drawbacks of using such embedding. Moreover, you will learn how to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) instead of RNN - because yes, it is possible ;)
