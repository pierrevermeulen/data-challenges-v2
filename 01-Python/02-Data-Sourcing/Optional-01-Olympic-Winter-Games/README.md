## üèÖ Olympic Winter Games

Now that you have understood the basics of loading data from a CSV, let's work with a real dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games). If you have a look at the `data` folder in this challenge, you will find two files coming from Kaggle (you don't need to download anything):

- `dictionary.csv`
- `winter.csv`

Go ahead and open those two files in Sublime Text to try & understand what they contain. The goal of this challenge is to implement the method in `winter_olympic_games.py`:

1. Who won the most winter olympic games medals (gold/silver/bronze) ever? (Hint: there's just one)
2. From `min_year` to `max_year`, which country won the most gold medals?
3. Find the three women with the most 5000 meters medals(gold/silver/bronze).

‚ö†Ô∏è For this challenge, you _can't_ use `pandas` yet üòâ. Let's see how far you can go with just Python & the [`csv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html).

For this part of the challenge, you can use `make` to check your implementation for the three questions.

```bash
make
```

After each question is solved, please run the checks + `add`/`commit`/`push` your code in this current challenge. Don't wait to solve the three questions.
