# Machine Learning Fundamentals

In the following challenges, you will train and score 3 Machine Learning models:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression (binary and multiclass!)
- K-Nearest-Neighbours

Throughout the exercises, you will be implementing the Holdout Method to ensure the scores reflect the models' capacity to generalize on new data.

You will also use Learning Curves to diagnose model performance, and make predictions on new data!
