In this exercise, we will learn how to train a [Logistic Regression Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html?highlight=logistic%20regression#sklearn-linear-model-logisticregression), to score this training and to make predictions on unseen data using the [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.

## The dataset

- `rating` : the rating of the university in a range [0,5]
- `CGPA` : the Cumulative Grade Points Average of the student
- `admitted` : whether or not a student is admitted to the university

## Exercise

The task is to predict if a student will be **admitted** to a university considering his CGPA and the rating of the university he is applying to.

To start the exercise, open `Logistic_Regression.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
