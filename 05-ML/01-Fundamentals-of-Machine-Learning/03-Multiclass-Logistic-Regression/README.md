# Multiclass Logistic Regression

## The dataset

- `rating` : the rating of the university in a range [0,5]
- `CGPA` : the Cumulative Grade Points Average of the student
- `admitted` : whether or not a student is admitted to the university

## Specs

The task is now multiclass. You must predict the university **rating** based on the student's CGPA and whether or not he got accepted.

You will then use the trained model to answer some questions.

To start the exercise, open `Multiclass_Logistic_Regression.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
