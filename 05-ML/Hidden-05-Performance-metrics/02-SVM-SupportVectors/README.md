Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models used for either classification or regression tasks. The algorithm is based on the "Support Vectors", the data points located at the border of two classes. According to those, SVMs fit a separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes. 

In this first exercice, you will:
 - Generate a random dataset
 - Train a Support Vector Machine
 - Visualize its Support Vectors
 - Change the Support Vector Paramaters
