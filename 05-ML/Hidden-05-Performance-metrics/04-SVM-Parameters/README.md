Each Machine Learning algorithm has specific parameters that affect its performance. For Support Vector Machines, the main parameters are:
- 'C'
- 'Kernel'
- 'Gamma'

You already know that 'C' manages the error function according to the Support Vectors.

In this exercice, you will explore the other two parameters.
