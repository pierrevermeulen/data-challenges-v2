In this exercice, you will familiarize yourself with the systematic use of cross-validation to evaluate model performance. You will:

- Train and score a baseline model
- Improve the baseline score by training a KNN model
- Improve the KNN model's score by preprocessing the features
- Make predictions on new data with the best model

To start the exercise, open `Cross-Validation.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

ðŸš€ Your turn!
