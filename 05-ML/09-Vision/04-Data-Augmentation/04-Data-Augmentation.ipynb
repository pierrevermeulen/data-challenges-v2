This is because MNIST Fashion is very homogeneous between the train and the test sets. This means that the augmented dataset is quite different from the data used to test the algorithm.

This is why the developments of deep learning algorithms for computer vision like the *convolutional neural networks* (CNN) are mostly used for computer vision.\n"
