In this exercise, you will learn to manipulate images with Numpy. You will see how to do convolution and use that to manually create filters (like bluring) on images. Then, we will look at preprocessing methods, for instance used as first steps before images are given to convolutional network.

Let's start by opening the notebook `01.ipynb`.
