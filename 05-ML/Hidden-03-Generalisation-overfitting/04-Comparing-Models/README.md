# Comparing Models

In this exercice, you must preprocess a dataset, train both a KNN and Naive Bayes models, and compare their performance.

Apply the preprocessing steps you have learnt thus far and consider necessary. When evaluating the performance of the models, use the correct approach.

Good luck!
