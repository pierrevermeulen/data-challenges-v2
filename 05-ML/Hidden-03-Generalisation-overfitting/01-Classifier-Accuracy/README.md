### Introduction

In this exercice we are going to find how **accurate** is our **kNN classifier**.
We will also try to differenciate **pro** from **amateur** basket-ball players.

**Dataset:** `Basket_Ball_Players.csv`

**Columns:**
**Height**, range [150, 220], height in centimeter
**3-Pointers**, range [0, 30], 3-Pointers done in one minutes
**Pro-Player**, range [0,1]

To start the exercise open `01-Classifier-Accuracy.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook`.
