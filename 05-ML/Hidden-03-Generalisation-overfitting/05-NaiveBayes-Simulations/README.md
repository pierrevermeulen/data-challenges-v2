# Naive Bayes simulations

In this exercice, you will  generate data to analyse the differences between KNN and Naive Bayes in more depth. You will observe the reaction of the models to correlated and uncorrelated data, and compare their computing time.

```bash
jupyter notebook 03-Naive-Bayes-Simulations.ipynb
```
